# GameApplication
This project was made with JavaFX & Eclipse in Windows Programming (CMPE 361). The project was about building an application with 2 tabs: One tab has a “Guess the Number” game, and the second has a “Find x game”. The latter game also has an advanced level, and the user is free to customize the font size and color of the game.
