# JavaFX Game Application

This project was made with JavaFX & Eclipse in Windows Programming (CMPE 361). 

The project was about building an application with 2 tabs: 

1. One tab has a “Guess the Number” game, and the second has a “Find x game”.
2. The latter game also has an advanced level, and the user is free to customize the font size and color of the game.
